# Umbree's Web Resources

## This repository hosts static assets and supporting resources used by [my website](https://umbree.gizmonic-institute.com/).

## It exists primarily to avoid file size and embedding limitations from my website provider. Rather than compress or fragment larger components, they are stored and versioned here.

## Purpose:
### This repository serves as:
- External hosting for larger code segments
- Structured data storage
- Static assets referenced by the website
- A version-controlled backup of deployed resources
### It is not a standalone project and is not intended for direct use outside of the site it supports.

## Structure:
Resources are organized by type and usage.
Where applicable, attribution or licensing information is included alongside the resource or within a dedicated attribution file.

## Licensing & Attribution
Some resources may originate from third-party authors or open-source projects.
Relevant copyright and licensing information is preserved within the corresponding resource directory.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are a rights holder and need clarification or adjustment, feel free to open an issue.

## Stability:
Files may be updated, replaced, or reorganized without notice.
External linking is discouraged unless you understand that paths may change.

With that all said-- what are ya doing here.
